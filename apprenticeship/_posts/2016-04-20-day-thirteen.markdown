My Rock, Paper, Scissors is taking longer than I estimated, and today, it got hard.  I felt like I was wading through my code and really having to force it to do what I wanted.  This, I know, is not what it should feel like.  How many times before have I had this feeling?  Many.  And how many times has it been because there's something wrong with my approach or design?  Every time.  But I am not yet at a point that I can recognise that whilst it's happening.  I know it shouldn't be so hard.  But sometimes it's hard because I don't know enough, and sometimes it's hard because I'm doing something wrong.  Retrospectivley, I can tell which, but when I'm in the middle of trying to get something to work, I can't tell the difference.  I suppose this will come with practice.

For now, with regard to my Rock, Paper, Scissors, I feel that my problem is coming from injecting my App and game into the console, and not the other way around.  This is forcing my console to deal with looping logic for a draw and if the user input isn't valid.  That's not right.  The console shouldn't care about that.  All I want my console to do is output and read input.

So, I'm changing it.  It should be simple enough to switch it, and it should make everything much more streamlined.  I learnt pretty early on not to get too emotionally invested in my code, and I have no problem deleting something that could have taken me hours to write, but I want to learn how to change faster.  I've got other stories to complete.  In general, most of the code I have written has been on my own time, so I can take time to try something and, if it doesn't work, try something else.  Here, yes, I'm still in charge of my time, but having to redo something takes up time that I want to use for other stories, but I know this will come in practice.  Recognising a problem earlier, and rectifying it earlier will come, and hopefully it'll happen sooner rather than later.
