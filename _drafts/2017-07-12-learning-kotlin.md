# Learning Kotlin

I have been learning Kotlin.  I've recently decided to learn some more Android, and since Kotlin is now the official language of Kotlin, I decided that this time around, I was going to do it in Kotlin.

So, here's a few things I have learnt whilst learning Kotlin:

1. My Java is nowhere near perfect

This was something I didn't expect to discover.  I mean, I knew my Java wasn't perfect, but I did not realise how far from perfect it was.  There is so much I don't know about Java, and not just about Java, but the whole Java eco-system.  I have used gradle a fair number of times, but am still not sure how it works.

2. Learning a new language is hard

This is obvious, but for some reason I thought that because Kotlin was so similar to Java I would pick it up quite quickly.  This is not happening.  I am still finding it difficult.
